How to run the program:

                         Select Build and Run

                         All possible prompts:

                          - When the program asks for a input file name, enter bookData3.txt (this is prompted before the first menu)

                          - When the program asks for a number at the first menu enter a valid integer (0-5)
                             0:  Check to see if a book is sold by the store (search)
                             1:  Update the number of copies of a book
                             2:  Print a list of books in stock
                             3:  Print a list of all books sold
                             4:  Sell the number of copies of a book
                             5:  Exit the program
                          
                          - When the program asks for a number at the second menu enter a valid integer (6-8)
                             6:  Search a book by its title
                             7:  Search a book by its ISBN
                             8:  Search a book by its author

                          - When the program asks for a book title, ISBN, or author name enter a valid string 
                             - book title (ex. Thinking in Java)
                             - ISBN (ex. 978-0-567-55555-9)
                             - author name (ex. Morgan, Alysha or Morgan, Alysha R.)

                          - When the program asks for a number of books enter a valid integer (an integer that is greater than 0 or an integer that does not cause the                             stock to fall below zero)

                          - Note: If errors are made, program will inform user on how to fix said errors.

Prior to running the program, please make sure that the project file, client file (main.cpp), implementation files (bookTypeImp.cpp and exbookType.h), header files (bookType.h, exbookType.h, and bookStore.h), and library file (bookData3.txt) are extracted from the zip file (morgan-pa3-210.zip) and placed in the same directory/folder.
